# Special thanks ðŸ˜Š to [Zernonia](https://github.com/zernonia) for this great challenge :)

I really learned a lot as a school student. Although it was hard, but no one does something without obstacles, everyone should work hard to achieve a mission/achievement!

## What is this challenge?

This challenge main mission is to `fetch` from API and display **dynamic content**. More info is available [here](https://blog.zernonia.com/i-design-you-build-frontend-challenge-4-supabase-version) in [Zernonia's blog](https://blog.zernonia.com/). 

## What did I use?

I did **2 attempts**, both were **successful**. But I think I will try a **2nd** attempt with **less tech-stack used**.

-------------------------------------------------

### My first-attempt tech-stack

- **Netlify**
- **React**
- **Remix**
- **Tailwind CSS**

----------------------------------------

### My second-attempt tech-stack

- **Netlify**
